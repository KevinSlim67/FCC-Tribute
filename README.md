# Alan Turing Tribute

This project is a tribute to Alan Turing, a major contributor to mathematics, cryptanalysis, computer science, and artificial intelligence.


## Description

This project was made for FreeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design course. It was my introduction to the world of Web Development. It was a way for me to learn the basics of HTML5 and CSS. 
I limited myself to HTML5 and CSS because I wanted to fully understand the basics before moving on to more prominent features, and later on, more frameworks and libraries (such as React or Angular). 

## Built Using
* HTML5
* CSS
