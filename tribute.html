                            and logician who made major contributions to mathematics, cryptanalysis,
                            logic, philosophy, and mathematical biology and also to the new areas later
                            named computer science, cognitive science, artificial intelligence,

                            Turing's life ended in tragedy. Convicted of "indecency" for his sexual
                            orientation, Turing lost his security clearance, was chemically castrated,
                            and later committed suicide at age 41. </p>

                    <li> <p><strong>1922 : </strong>Turing is sent to Hazelhurst Preparatory School where he does much better and learns to play chess.</p> 
                    </li>
                    <li> <p><strong>1926 - 1931 : </strong>He went on to Sherborne School, a well-known independent school in the market town of Sherborne in Dorset. His first day of term coincided with the 1926 General Strike. </p>
                    </li>
                    <li> <p><strong>1928 : </strong>Turing encountered Albert Einstein‘s work; not only did he grasp it, but he extrapolated Einstein’s questioning of Newton’s laws of motion from a text in which this was never made explicit. Turing enters 6th form at Sherborne and becomes great friends with Christopher Morcom, another talented boy who loves Maths and Science.</p> 
                    </li>
                    <li> <p><strong>1930 : </strong>Turing’s close school friend Christopher Morcom dies suddenly from bovine tuberculosis. Turing is devastated, renounces his religious faith and becomes an atheist.</p> 
                    </li>
                    <li> <p><strong>1931 - 1934 : </strong>Enters King’s College, Cambridge, as mathematics scholar. He gained first-class honours in Mathematics.</p> 
                    </li>
                    <li> <p><strong>1935 : </strong>Elected fellow of King’s College for his dissertation “Central Limit Theorem of Probability” Turing attended Max Newman‘s advanced course on the foundations of mathematics. He learnt that Hilbert’s Entsceidungsproblem (decision problem) was still open. Turing was motivated by Gödel’s work to seek an algorithmic method of determining whether any given propositions were undecidable, with the ultimate goal of eliminating them from mathematics..</p> 
                    </li>
                    <li> <p><strong>1936 : </strong>Submitted on 28 May 1936 and delivered 12 November to London Mathematical Society: On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem (decision problem) in which he outlines the Universal Machine, which later became known as the Turing Machine. This was an idealised computing device that is capable of performing any mathematical computation that can be represented as an algorithm. </p>

                                <p><strong>1938 : </strong>He obtained his PhD from Princeton University; his Ph.D. thesis under the direction of the American mathematician Alonzo Church, Systems of Logic Based on Ordinals, introduced the concept of ordinal logic and the notion of relative computing, where Turing machines are augmented with so-called oracles, allowing a study of problems that cannot be solved by a Turing machine. He then returned to England and accepted a renewed fellowship at King’s College. From September 1938, Turing had been working part-time with the Government Code and Cypher School (GCCS), the British code breaking organisation. He concentrated on Cryptanalysis of the Enigma, with Dilly Knox, a senior GCCS codebreaker. </p>

September – Turing is asked to join the Government Codes and Ciphers School and arrives at Bletchley Park the day after war is declared. There he works with Gordon Welchman to develop the Bombe, a device for decrypting the messages sent by Germans using their Enigma machines. The Bombe built on a machine that the Polish had already made, called the Bomba Kryptlogiczna. Many of Germany’s secret messages could be deciphered and read with it.</p>

                    <li> <p><strong>1941 : </strong>Turing proposed marriage to Hut 8 co-worker Joan Clarke, a fellow mathematician and cryptanalyst, but their engagement was short-lived. After admitting his homosexuality to his fiancée, who was reportedly “unfazed” by the revelation, Turing decided that he could not go through with the marriage.</p> 
                    </li>
                    <li> <p><strong>1942 : </strong>Turing and his colleagues  break the more complicated German Naval Enigma system. Turing travelled to the United States in November and worked with U.S. Navy cryptanalysts on Naval Enigma and bombe construction in Washington, visiting their Computing Machine Laboratory at Dayton, Ohio.</p> 
                    </li>
                    <li> <p><strong>1943 : </strong>Turing is asked to work as a top level intelligence link with USA, which he visits to share information on cryptology (code-breaking). Works at Bell Laboratories on speech encypherment.</p>

                        Begins designing a stored-program machine (MOSAIC), which will store data and programs in its electronic memory.
                        Turing’s ‘Proposed Electronic Calculator‘ is circulated, setting out the design of the ACE (Automatic Computing Engine). In it, he suggests that computers will ‘play very good chess‘.
                        Published “A Method for the Calculation of the Zeta-Function”, which constitutes his first printed contribution to the subject.
                        Turing was awarded the OBE for his wartime services, but his work remained secret for many years.
                        October: Turing joined the  National Physical Laboratory (NPL) where he worked on developing an electronic digital stored-program computing machine that would later become the ACE (Automatic Computing Engine). By 1946 he had a finished proposal for the computer, but NPL did not have the resources to turn it into reality.
                        ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer) is the second large-scale electronic computer to operate.</p>

                    <li> <p><strong>1946 : </strong>19 February, published the first detailed design of a stored-program computer.
                        Turing and his group pioneer modern computer programming, writing a library of sophisticated programs for the unbuilt ACE.
                        Turing presents a course of lectures on Versions V, VI, and VII of the ACE design, at the Ministry of Supply in London (Dec. 1946 to Feb. 1947).</p>

                        He also invented the LU decomposition method in 1948, used today for solving matrix equations.
                        Manchester wins the race: the world’s first stored-program electronic computer comes to life on June 21 in Newman‘s Computing Machine Laboratory.
                        Turing, now at Manchester as Deputy Director of the Computing Machine Laboratory, writes ‘Intelligent Machinery‘, the first manifesto of Artificial Intelligence.
                        Turing joined Max Newman’s Computing Laboratory at Manchester University,  where he wrote programs for the Manchester Automatic Digital Machine (MADAM), the computer with the largest memory capacity in the world at that time.
                        Turing, working with his former undergraduate colleague, D. G. Champernowne, began writing a chess program for a computer that did not yet exist. Lacking a computer powerful enough to execute the program, Turing played a game in which he simulated the computer, taking about half an hour per move.</p>

                        Publishes Computing Machinery and Intelligence, introducing a test of intelligence, that he said would prove a machine could think. This test later became known as the Turing Test, an attempt to define a standard for a machine to be called “intelligent”. Turing was convinced that if a computer could do all mathematical operations, it could also do anything a person can do, a still highly controversial opinion.</p>
